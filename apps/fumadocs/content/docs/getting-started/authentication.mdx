# Authentication

All requests to the Drovi Intelligence API require authentication using an API key.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your Drovi dashboard at [app.drovi.io](https://app.drovi.io)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Backend" or "Development")
5. Select the appropriate scopes for your use case
6. Copy and securely store your API key

<Callout type="warning">
API keys are only shown once when created. Store them securely - you won't be able to see the full key again.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.drovi.io/api/v1/uios \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123..."
```

With the Python SDK:

```python
from drovi import DroviClient

client = DroviClient(api_key="sk_live_abc123...")
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export DROVI_API_KEY="sk_live_abc123..."
```

```python
from drovi import DroviClient

client = DroviClient()  # Automatically reads DROVI_API_KEY
```

## API Key Scopes

API keys can have different permission scopes:

| Scope | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `read` | Read-only access to data | Dashboards, reporting |
| `write` | Create and update data | Applications, integrations |
| `admin` | Full access including config | Admin tools |
| `manage:keys` | Manage API keys | Key rotation scripts |

### Scope Hierarchy

Higher-level scopes include all lower-level permissions:

```
admin > write > read
```

An `admin` key can do everything a `write` or `read` key can do.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per Minute | Burst |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| Free | 60 | 10 |
| Pro | 300 | 50 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 299
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067260
```

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 30 seconds.",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

## Key Security Best Practices

### Do

- Store API keys in environment variables or secret managers
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use the minimum required scope for each key
- Monitor key usage in the dashboard

### Don't

- Commit API keys to version control
- Share keys between team members (create individual keys)
- Use production keys in development environments
- Include keys in client-side code or logs

## Revoking API Keys

If you suspect a key has been compromised:

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the dashboard
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Create a new key and update your applications

Revoked keys stop working immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify the key is correct (check for typos)
- Ensure the key hasn't been revoked
- Check the key hasn't expired
- Verify the `X-API-Key` header is set correctly

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "forbidden",
  "message": "Insufficient permissions for this operation"
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Check the key has the required scope
- Upgrade to a higher scope if needed
- Verify you're accessing the correct organization
