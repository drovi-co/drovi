# Your First Request

Let's extract intelligence from a piece of text. This guide will walk you through making your first API request.

## The Analyze Endpoint

The `/api/v1/analyze` endpoint is the core of Drovi Intelligence. It takes text content and extracts structured intelligence objects.

## Basic Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.drovi.io/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_123",
    "content": "Hi John, thanks for the meeting yesterday. I will send you the Q4 report by Friday. Let me know if you have questions about the budget we discussed - I think we should go with Option B for the marketing spend.",
    "source_type": "email",
    "user_email": "alice@company.com",
    "metadata": {
      "subject": "Follow-up from yesterday",
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123"
    }
  }'
```

## Understanding the Response

```json
{
  "trace_id": "trace_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "extracted": {
    "commitments": [
      {
        "id": "comm_xyz",
        "title": "Send Q4 report",
        "description": "Alice committed to sending the Q4 report to John",
        "direction": "owed_by_me",
        "counterparty": "John",
        "due_date_text": "Friday",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "quoted_text": "I will send you the Q4 report by Friday"
      }
    ],
    "decisions": [
      {
        "id": "dec_xyz",
        "title": "Go with Option B for marketing spend",
        "status": "proposed",
        "rationale": "Based on discussion about budget",
        "confidence": 0.82,
        "quoted_text": "I think we should go with Option B for the marketing spend"
      }
    ],
    "tasks": [],
    "risks": [],
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": "q_xyz",
        "question": "Questions about budget discussion",
        "status": "open",
        "confidence": 0.78,
        "quoted_text": "Let me know if you have questions about the budget we discussed"
      }
    ]
  },
  "entities_resolved": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "type": "person",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "type": "person",
      "email": "alice@company.com"
    }
  ],
  "brief": {
    "summary": "Alice following up on meeting, committing to send Q4 report by Friday and proposing Option B for marketing budget.",
    "key_points": [
      "Commitment to send Q4 report by Friday",
      "Proposal to use Option B for marketing spend"
    ],

```

## Intelligence Types Explained

### Commitments

Things people have promised to do. Tracked bidirectionally:
- `owed_by_me`: You committed to do something
- `owed_to_me`: Someone committed to do something for you

### Decisions

Conclusions reached or proposed. Status can be:
- `made`: Final decision
- `proposed`: Suggestion, not finalized
- `deferred`: Postponed for later
- `reversed`: Changed from a previous decision

### Tasks

Action items with ownership and status. Can have:
- Subtasks
- Dependencies
- Effort estimates

### Risks

Potential issues identified:
- Contradictions with previous statements
- Policy violations
- Deal risks
- Deadline concerns

### Questions

Open questions that need answers:
- Direct questions asked
- Implicit questions (areas needing clarification)

## With the Python SDK

```python
from drovi import DroviClient

client = DroviClient(api_key="your_api_key")

result = client.analyze(
    organization_id="org_123",
    content="""
    Hi John, thanks for the meeting yesterday.
    I will send you the Q4 report by Friday.
    Let me know if you have questions about the budget we discussed -
    I think we should go with Option B for the marketing spend.
    """,
    source_type="email",
    user_email="alice@company.com",
    metadata={
        "subject": "Follow-up from yesterday",
        "thread_id": "thread_abc123"
    }
)

# Access extracted intelligence
for commitment in result.commitments:
    print(f"Commitment: {commitment.title}")
    print(f"  Due: {commitment.due_date_text}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {commitment.confidence}")

for decision in result.decisions:
    print(f"Decision: {decision.title}")
    print(f"  Status: {decision.status}")
```

## Bulk Analysis

For processing multiple items:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.drovi.io/api/v1/analyze/batch \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_123",
    "items": [
      {
        "content": "First email content...",
        "source_type": "email",
        "metadata": {"thread_id": "1"}
      },
      {
        "content": "Second email content...",
        "source_type": "email",
        "metadata": {"thread_id": "2"}
      }
    ]
  }'
```
