# Getting Started

From zero to queryable memory in minutes. This guide will help you set up Drovi Intelligence and make your first API request.

## Three Ways to Use Drovi

## Choose Your Path

### REST API — Direct Integration

Extract intelligence from any content with simple HTTP requests. No SDK required.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.drovi.io/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -d '{"content": "I will send the report by Friday", "source_type": "email"}'
```

**Best for:** Backend integrations, custom workflows, any language

→ [Get started with the API](/getting-started/first-request)

### Connectors — Automatic Ingestion

Connect your data sources and let Drovi continuously ingest and process everything.

- **Email:** Gmail, Outlook
- **Messaging:** Slack, Teams, WhatsApp
- **Documents:** Notion, Google Docs

**Best for:** Continuous memory building, organizational knowledge

→ [Set up your first connector](/connectors)

### MCP Tools — Agent Memory

Enable AI agents to query organizational memory through the Model Context Protocol.

```python
# Your agent queries before acting
context = await mcp.call_tool("drovi", "get_customer_context", {
    "contact_email": "john@acme.com"
})
```

**Best for:** AI assistants, autonomous agents, context-aware applications

→ [Enable MCP tools](/mcp-tools)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- **Drovi account** — Sign up at [app.drovi.io](https://app.drovi.io)
- **API key** — Created in your dashboard under Settings → API Keys
- **REST client** — cURL, Postman, or your favorite HTTP library

## What You'll Build

By the end of these guides, you'll have:

1. **An API key** configured with the right scopes
2. **Your first extraction** — commitments, decisions, and risks from text
3. **Understanding** of how the memory layer works
