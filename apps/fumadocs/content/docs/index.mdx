# Drovi Intelligence

A shared, queryable intelligence layer that humans, agents, and systems rely on to know what's true. What was decided. What was promised. What's still owed.

## Companies don't lack tools. They lack memory.

Decisions scattered across tools, never connected. Commitments made and forgotten. No single view across teams and customers. The same discussions repeat endlessly.

**Drovi changes this.** A shared memory layer that ingests every source, extracts decisions, commitments, ownership, and risks, resolves entities and relationships across boundaries, and exposes everything via API, UI, and agent-ready interfaces.

## What Lives in Memory

The memory layer doesn't just store information. It extracts, resolves, and persists structured knowledge — ready for humans and agents to query.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Commitments** | Structured objects with owner, status, due date, and full provenance chain |
| **Decisions** | What was decided, why, and what replaced it — linked to source evidence |
| **Entities** | Resolved people, companies, and projects — unified across all sources |
| **Ownership** | Who owns what, who promised what, and where work is blocked or waiting |
| **Risks** | Contradictions, dropped commitments, and policy violations — surfaced automatically |

## How the Memory Layer Works

From raw data to queryable truth:

1. **Ingest** — Connect email, chat, docs, meetings, and CRM. Drovi ingests everything — historical and real-time — into a unified data layer.

2. **Normalize** — Messages, threads, files, and events are standardized into a common schema. Every source speaks the same language.

3. **Extract** — AI extracts structured intelligence: decisions, commitments, ownership, deadlines, risks, and relationships.

4. **Resolve** — Entities are unified across sources. The same person, project, or commitment is recognized everywhere it appears.

5. **Persist** — Memory is stored in a graph with full provenance. Every fact links back to its source, and history is preserved.

6. **Expose** — Query via API, UI, or agent-ready interfaces. Humans and systems access the same truth.

## Built for Scale. Ready for Agents.

The memory layer is infrastructure — not an app. Designed to serve humans, agents, and systems at enterprise scale.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Universal Connectors** | Ingest from email, chat, docs, meetings, CRM, and custom sources |
| **Entity Resolution** | Unified identities across sources. The same person, project, or commitment is recognized everywhere |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Relationships, decisions, and commitments stored in a queryable graph with full provenance |
| **Agent-Ready APIs** | Structured endpoints for AI agents to read and write memory |
| **Historical Backfill** | Import years of history. Memory starts from day one |
| **Real-Time Sync** | Continuous ingestion keeps memory current. Changes propagate in seconds |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make your first request
curl -X POST https://api.drovi.io/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_123",
    "content": "I will send the report by Friday. We decided to go with Option B for the marketing campaign.",
    "source_type": "email"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "extracted": {
    "commitments": [{
      "title": "Send report",
      "due_date_text": "Friday",
      "direction": "owed_by_me",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }],
    "decisions": [{
      "title": "Go with Option B for marketing campaign",
      "status": "made",
      "confidence": 0.88
    }]
  }
}
```
