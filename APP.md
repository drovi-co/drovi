Drovi
The memory infrastructure for work
Problem
Modern organizations operate across dozens of tools, but none of them maintain shared memory.
Decisions, commitments, ownership, and customer context emerge in conversations emails, chats, meetings, documents then
fragment across systems. Over time, this context contradicts itself, decays, or disappears.
As companies adopt AI agents, the problem compounds:
Agents can act, but they don't remember
Systems can execute, but they don't understand state
Work today lacks a persistent, queryable memory layer.
Solution
Drovi is memory infrastructure for work.
Drovi continuously ingests activity across internal and external systems and builds a living intelligence graph that represents
how work actually unfolds over time.
The product UI is only one interface.
The core asset is the memory layer itself exposed to:
Internal tools
AI agents
Workflow engines
MCP-compatible systems
CRM platforms
Drovi becomes the source of truth for context, not another destination app.
What Drovi Provides
Drovi transforms unstructured activity into structured, evolving intelligence objects:
Decisions with rationale, alternatives, and supersession
Commitments who owes what to whom, by when, and status
Tasks ownership, dependencies, execution state
Risks contradictions, policy violations, deal and relationship risk
Relationships health, influence, engagement, lifecycle stage
Key Characteristics
Each object is:
Evidence-backed across sources
Identity-resolved across systems
Bi-temporal (what was true vs what is now)
Continuously updated as new information arrives
This creates a memory substrate that both humans and machines can trust.
Architecture
High-Level Overview
1. Multi-source ingestion
Email, chat, meetings, docs, CRM, code, calendars
2. Unified conversation model
All activity normalized into consistent conversations
3. Intelligence extraction layer
Specialized agents extract decisions, commitments, risks, tasks
4. Identity-first resolution
People, not tools, are the primary entities
5. Memory graph
Persistent intelligence stored in a graph with evolution and decay
6. Exposure layer
Query API
Agent-accessible memory (MCP / tools)
CRM sync
Internal tooling hooks
The UI showcases the system. The infrastructure powers everything else.
Why This Matters for AI
AI agents require context continuity to be useful.
Without Memory
Agents repeat work
Violate prior decisions
Miss commitments
Act on outdated information
With Drovi
Drovi provides agents with answers to critical questions:
"What has already been decided?"
"What is still open?"
"Who owns this?"
"What changed?"
"What's at risk?"
Drovi turns agents from stateless executors into context-aware operators.
Why Now
The convergence of three factors makes this the right moment:
Tool sprawl has reached a breaking point
AI agents are entering production workflows
Execution speed is increasing while continuity collapses
The next bottleneck in software is not intelligence; it's memory.
Vision
Every company will run with AI agents.
Every agent will need shared, trusted memory.
Drovi becomes the memory backbone for modern organizations, the layer that internal tools, workflows, and agents consult
before acting.
The UI is the first surface. The infrastructure is the business.
Status
Core memory graph and extraction pipeline live
Multi-source ingestion operational
Agent-facing architecture in progress
Stealth pilots with Startups
Closing
CRMs manage records
Agents execute actions
Drovi maintains truth over time

Drovi
The memory infrastructure for work
A persistent intelligence layer for humans and AI agents.
Jeremy Scatigna " Founder
Companies don't lack tools.
They lack memory.
Decisions live in conversations
Commitments decay across tools
Context contradicts itself over time
Result: teams re-decide, agents misfire, execution drifts.
AI without memory is unreliable.
Agents don't know what was already decided
They violate prior commitments
They act on partial or outdated context
Stateless intelligence b execution
Memory is infrastructure.
Every company needs:
A shared source of truth
A record of how decisions evolve
Context that outlives tools and people
This layer does not exist today.
Drovi is the memory layer for work.
Connects to where work happens
Extracts decisions, commitments, ownership, risk
Maintains them as living intelligence
Not an app. A substrate.
Drovi stores intelligence, not data.
Decisions (with rationale & supersession)
Commitments (who owes what, by when)
Tasks (ownership & dependencies)
Risks (contradictions, policy, deal risk)
Relationships (health, influence, lifecycle)
Each object: evidence-backed, cross-system, continuously updated
Humans use the app. Agents use the layer.
UI (Reference)
APIs (Production)
Humans explore, verify, and update memory
Agents query before acting: "What's decided?"
This is a systems problem.
Identity resolution across tools
Contradiction detection over time
Memory evolution & decay
Signal vs noise at scale
UI is easy. Memory is not.
Every AI-native company needs memory.
40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026
Agents entering production, failing without context
Tool sprawl accelerating; CRMs failing as truth systems
Drovi sits underneath the stack.
Monetize the surface, own the layer.
SaaS for teams ($29/mo, per user)
Usage-based memory & agent API calls
Enterprise / on-prem licensing
Long-term infra licensing to platforms
Built and in use.
Multi-source ingestion live
Intelligence extraction in production
Memory graph implemented
Stealth pilot with startups
The system of truth for AI-native work.
Every company will run agents.
Every agent will need memory.
Drovi becomes the memory backbone.
