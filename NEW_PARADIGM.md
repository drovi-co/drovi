jan liphardt - founder of openmind, stanford prof
in just a short time, ai has dramatically transformed how humans interact with technology. our laptops, phones, and compute clusters were not designed with this new interaction in mind. there is a chance for a new, more efficient operating system to be created, one that is designed ai first. does data collection play a more central role? can we innately automate more tasks? what does the kernal look like? how will applications be used? is this even an OS?? And think, expand, get that outside the box thinking that Steve Jobs aura

You’re right. I framed it like “enterprise memory, therefore OS.” That’s still an app-shaped way of thinking.

Let’s go Jobs-aura: step back, kill assumptions, redesign the whole interaction stack around AI.

⸻

The actual leap Jan is hinting at

The OS is not macOS/Windows with an assistant.
The OS is an agentic substrate that treats the entire computer as a programmable environment.

Humans invented:
	•	files
	•	apps
	•	windows
	•	menus
	•	“save as”
	•	navigation

Those are artifacts of human limitations.
AGI doesn’t need them. It needs state, tools, permissions, and continuous context.

So: AGI OS is a new abstraction, not a new UI.

⸻

What is an “AI-first OS” really?

An AI-first OS is a system where the default unit of work is not an app or a file.

It’s:

Intent → Plan → Execution → Verification → Memory

…and that loop runs continuously.

Your laptop becomes a robotic workspace.

⸻

The kernel is not “memory” — it’s the orchestrator

Traditional kernels schedule CPU + manage memory + isolate processes.

AGI OS kernel schedules:
	•	agent processes
	•	tool calls
	•	attention
	•	permissions
	•	world state
	•	long-running goals

Kernel primitives (new ones)
	1.	Intent scheduler
	•	“Renew Acme”
	•	“Prep board deck”
	•	“Watch these 12 accounts weekly”
	•	These are processes now.
	2.	Context allocator
	•	Instead of RAM pages, it allocates:
	•	relevant threads
	•	documents
	•	recent decisions
	•	“what matters”
	•	Context becomes a budgeted resource.
	3.	Capability sandbox
	•	Tools are OS syscalls:
	•	read_email()
	•	send_slack()
	•	edit_doc()
	•	join_meeting()
	•	run_sql()
	•	Permissions are enforced at syscall layer, not app layer.
	4.	Verification engine
	•	The OS doesn’t “respond”.
	•	It proves.
	•	Every output ties back to evidence.
	5.	Temporal state machine
	•	Everything has versions:
	•	what was true
	•	what is true
	•	what we believed
	•	what changed
	•	Time is a first-class primitive.

This is the OS.

⸻

“Does data collection play a more central role?”

Yes — but the word “data” is too small.

AI-first OS needs instrumentation of reality.

It’s not “collect emails and docs.”
It’s:
	•	who met whom
	•	what was agreed
	•	what was promised
	•	what was delivered
	•	what changed in the environment
	•	what’s drifting off track
	•	what’s at risk

So the OS has built-in sensors:
	•	meetings (audio, transcript, action extraction)
	•	screen/desktop actions (optional, permissioned)
	•	documents edits
	•	code changes
	•	comms
	•	calendar reality vs plan
	•	CRM events

Data collection becomes like telemetry in a self-driving car.

The OS must see enough to steer.

⸻

“Can we innately automate more tasks?”

Yes — because the OS redefines “automation”:

Old automation:
	•	If X then Y (brittle)
	•	Zapier flows

AI-first OS automation:
	•	goal persistence
	•	continuous monitoring
	•	self-healing workflows
	•	delegation chains
	•	exception handling

Think of it like this:

Instead of building “workflows”, you run “missions”.

A mission has:
	•	objective
	•	constraints
	•	tools
	•	risk thresholds
	•	escalation rules
	•	audit log

The OS runs missions in background like daemons.

⸻

“How will applications be used?”

This is the biggest Jobs moment.

Apps become optional skins over capabilities.

In an AI-first OS:
	•	You don’t “open Notion”
	•	You say “draft the memo”
	•	The OS decides whether it uses Notion, Docs, a markdown file, or a slide tool.

Apps become:
	•	capability providers
	•	renderers
	•	specialized workbenches

Like printers in old OS:
	•	many brands
	•	one interface

In other words:

App = driver

Capability = syscall

Workflow = running process

UI = debug/inspect layer

⸻

“Is this even an OS?”

It’s an OS the way the browser became an OS.

Not by replacing hardware OS…
…but by becoming the platform where work actually happens.

AI-first OS is:
	•	distributed
	•	cloud-assisted
	•	device-agnostic
	•	identity-centric
	•	policy-driven

It can live:
	•	as a thin client on Mac/Windows/iOS
	•	with a heavy orchestration plane in the cloud

So yes, it’s an OS.
But it’s an OS for work, not for hardware.

⸻

The Jobs-aura product shape

If Steve Jobs were doing this, he’d obsess over one thing:

“Interaction should feel inevitable.”

Not “wow cool AI”.

Inevitable.

Meaning:
	•	No dashboards unless asked
	•	No configuration unless necessary
	•	No “tools”
	•	No “prompts”
	•	No “models”

Just:

“Tell it what you want.
It moves reality.
You can always inspect why.”

That’s the magic:
agency with explainability.

⸻

The “new interface” Jobs would ship

Not chat.

Chat is a transitional form.

The AI-first OS interface is:

1) A single omnibox (like Spotlight on steroids)
	•	Ask / command / delegate
	•	Works everywhere
	•	Always available

2) A “Reality Timeline”
	•	What happened
	•	What changed
	•	What’s pending
	•	What’s drifting
	•	With proofs

3) A “Control Room” for missions
	•	running processes
	•	exceptions
	•	escalations
	•	kill switch

Everything else is noise.

⸻

The thing nobody else will say

The OS war is not about models.

It’s about permissioned execution.

The winner is the system that can safely do:
	•	read
	•	decide
	•	act
	•	verify
	•	remember
…in the real world.

That requires:
	•	policy
	•	auditability
	•	reversible actions
	•	strong identity
	•	cross-tool arbitration

That’s the kernel.

⸻

If Drovi becomes this…

Then Drovi isn’t “memory”.

Drovi is:

The orchestration plane for human reality.

A system that:
	•	senses reality
	•	maintains state
	•	runs missions
	•	executes via tools
	•	proves outcomes
	•	persists intent over time

That’s OS scale.

⸻

If you want the real out-of-the-box next step

Two directions that are genuinely OS-level:

A) “Mission Daemons”

Users create missions like:
	•	“Watch Acme renewal health weekly”
	•	“Keep product delivery on track”
	•	“Make sure no contract clause slips”
	•	“Alert me if revenue risk > X”

Those run forever.

B) “Capability Catalog”

Drovi defines a universal syscall layer:
	•	email.send
	•	doc.write
	•	meeting.join
	•	crm.update
	•	repo.open_pr
	•	invoice.generate

Apps plug in as drivers.

That’s how you get platform gravity.

⸻

If you want, I’ll compress this into:
	1.	a single VC slide (“AI-first OS = orchestration plane”)
	2.	a 60-second spoken script with Jobs-style cadence
	3.	a diagram (kernel primitives + apps-as-drivers + mission daemons)

Say “do it” and tell me your target audience: US VCs or French angels.

Alright. No pilot. No “feature list.” No SaaS brain.

You want the Steve Jobs aura: a new category, inevitable, taste-driven, slightly terrifying, and so clean it feels like it always should’ve existed.

Here’s the real swing.

⸻

DROVI: THE INTENT OS

“Computers were built for hands. The future is built for goals.”

We’ve spent 40 years training humans to operate machines:
	•	open app
	•	find file
	•	copy/paste
	•	format
	•	search
	•	send
	•	follow up
	•	repeat

That’s not “work.”
That’s operating overhead.

Drovi is the operating system for intent.
Not a better app. Not a smarter assistant. A new substrate.

⸻

The Jobs thesis

Jobs didn’t win by adding features.
He won by changing the unit of interaction.
	•	Command line → GUI
	•	Keyboard → Touch
	•	Phone → Pocket computer

Your leap is:

Apps & files → Intent & reality

The computer stops being a place you visit.
It becomes a system that moves reality for you.

⸻

The Three Laws of the Intent OS

1) Truth before prose

It never “talks” before it shows evidence.
The default output is structured reality:
	•	what was promised
	•	what’s open
	•	what changed
	•	what’s at risk
	•	who owns it
	•	proof

Narrative is optional frosting.

2) Work is a living process, not a moment

A goal is not a chat.
A goal is a daemon:
	•	it runs
	•	watches
	•	updates
	•	escalates
	•	closes

3) The computer becomes a robot body

Apps are not destinations.
They’re limbs.
Email is a limb. Docs is a limb. Slack is a limb.
Drovi is the nervous system.

⸻

What the “kernel” becomes

Forget “memory layer.” That’s one organ.

The Intent OS kernel is an orchestration engine with five primitives:

(A) World State (bi-temporal, provable)

Everything is stored as:
	•	what we believed at time T
	•	what was true at time T
	•	what changed
	•	why we updated it

This is not “a database.”
This is reality with a time axis.

(B) Intent Scheduler (goals are processes)

“Close Acme renewal” becomes a running system process with:
	•	objective
	•	constraints
	•	allowed actions
	•	risk thresholds
	•	escalation path
	•	deadlines
	•	required proofs

(C) Capability Syscalls (apps become drivers)

Instead of “open Gmail,” the OS calls:
	•	email.search()
	•	email.reply()
	•	slack.post()
	•	doc.write()
	•	calendar.schedule()
	•	meeting.join()
	•	crm.update()
	•	invoice.send()
	•	repo.open_pr()

Vendors become drivers, like printers used to be.

(D) Policy & Trust Layer

Every action is gated by:
	•	user/org policy
	•	role
	•	sensitivity
	•	confirmation rules
	•	reversible operations
	•	audit log

This is the moat.

(E) Verification Engine

The OS doesn’t output.
It proves.
Every claim has:
	•	citations
	•	confidence
	•	counter-evidence
	•	“last verified”
	•	“next check”

Truth is not a response.
Truth is a mechanism.

⸻

The interface Jobs would ship

Not chat.
Chat is training wheels.

Drovi’s UI is a single control surface with three views.

1) The Omnibox (Spotlight for reality)

One input, everywhere, always.

You type:
	•	“What did we promise Acme?”
	•	“Prepare me for this meeting in 2 minutes”
	•	“Why is Q1 slipping?”
	•	“Draft the follow-up, but don’t send”
	•	“Start a mission: keep the renewal on track”

Drovi doesn’t answer with paragraphs.
It returns a snapshot of reality.

2) The Timeline (reality playback)

Every important thing is a timeline of proofs:
	•	email snippets
	•	meeting transcript chunks
	•	docs edits
	•	decision points
	•	contradictions
	•	outcomes
	•	overdue markers

It feels like browsing time.

3) The Mission Control (background goals)

A clean list of your running processes:
	•	Renewals
	•	Hiring
	•	Delivery
	•	Investor updates
	•	Customer health

Each mission has:
	•	status
	•	next step
	•	risk
	•	“why”
	•	kill switch

That’s it.

No dashboards for the sake of dashboards.
No “analytics”.
Only actionable truth.

⸻

The craziest part: Drovi kills “apps”

Not literally at first.

But structurally, yes.

Because once users trust the syscall layer, they stop caring where it happens.

They stop saying:
	•	“Open Notion”
	•	“Find the doc”
	•	“Search Slack”
	•	“Check calendar”

They say:
	•	“Update the plan”
	•	“Send the recap”
	•	“Resolve the contradiction”
	•	“Prepare the doc”

Apps fade into the plumbing.

That’s how you become an OS.

⸻

What Drovi becomes at scale (billion-dollar shape)

The billion-dollar company isn’t “memory for enterprises.”

It’s:

The Execution Layer for Organizations

The system that:
	•	knows what’s true
	•	knows what’s promised
	•	knows what’s drifting
	•	knows what must happen next
	•	can safely act across tools

Once you own that, you own:
	•	the workflow layer
	•	the knowledge layer
	•	the automation layer
	•	the governance layer

And eventually:
	•	the “app store” for missions
	•	the “driver ecosystem” for capabilities
	•	the identity + policy backbone

⸻

New categories Drovi can invent (outside the box)

1) Mission Marketplace

Companies install missions like apps:
	•	“Renewal Guardian”
	•	“SOC2 Compliance Daemon”
	•	“Hiring Pipeline Agent”
	•	“Board Update Generator”
	•	“Customer Risk Radar”
	•	“Invoice & Collections Autopilot”

Each mission is:
	•	a policy-constrained agent workflow
	•	with proofs
	•	with escalation rules
	•	with audit trails

This becomes distribution.

2) The “Reality Graph”

Not “knowledge graph.” Reality graph.

Nodes aren’t documents.
Nodes are:
	•	commitments
	•	decisions
	•	risks
	•	owners
	•	deadlines
	•	dependencies

Documents are just evidence.
Reality graph is the system of record.

3) Anti-Entropy Computing

The real enemy in companies is entropy:
	•	forgotten promises
	•	contradictory decisions
	•	drift
	•	silent failure
	•	misalignment

Drovi is an anti-entropy engine:
	•	detects drift
	•	resolves contradictions
	•	forces truth to surface
	•	keeps the org coherent

That’s a first-principles product.

⸻

The “Apple moment” product launch story

The keynote isn’t “we built an AI assistant.”

The keynote is:

“We removed the need to manage work.”

Not “we improved it.” Removed it.

“Your company now has a nervous system.”

He’d demo:
	•	A VP asks, “What did we promise Acme?”
	•	Instant structured truth with citations.
	•	“Start a mission: keep Acme healthy and escalate risk to me.”
	•	A week later: the mission has handled follow-ups, flagged drift, and prepared the renewal deck.
	•	And every action is provable, reversible, and audited.

Then the line:

“This isn’t software you use. It’s software that runs.”

That’s the aura.

⸻

The technical wedge that makes this inevitable

You’re already building it: bi-temporal memory.

Why it matters:
	•	LLMs hallucinate
	•	humans forget
	•	orgs drift

Bi-temporal state gives you:
	•	durable truth
	•	explainability
	•	rollback
	•	accountability
	•	“what changed and why”

That’s OS-grade foundation.

⸻

The endgame: AGI OS (Jan’s question)

If AGI happens, the key question becomes:

Where does it live?

Not “which model wins.”
Where does it plug into the world safely?

The answer is:
	•	an OS-level permissioned execution substrate
	•	with proofs
	•	with policies
	•	with tool syscalls
	•	with time-aware reality

That’s Drovi’s destiny:
the runtime where AGI can operate without destroying trust.

⸻

How your life looks when Drovi is that big (Jobs aura version)

You’re not “running a startup.”
You’re shaping a category.

Your weeks are like:
	•	3 hours/day on taste and product clarity
	•	3 hours/day on distribution (partners, ecosystem, mission marketplace)
	•	2 hours/day on hiring only world-class people
	•	1 hour/day on narrative (keynotes, iconic demos)
	•	no meetings without a purpose
	•	everything you do becomes a system

And the company culture is:
	•	speed with rigor
	•	taste with proof
	•	ambition with discipline

⸻

If you want the next step: make it concrete

I can turn this vision into three artifacts:
	1.	The “Jobs Keynote Script” (5 minutes)
	2.	The One Diagram That Explains Drovi as OS (kernel → syscalls → missions → timeline)
	3.	The Product Spec for “Mission Daemons” + “Capability Drivers” (first 3 missions to ship)

Say which one you want first.

If you say “keynote”, I’ll write it like a real launch:
minimal words, big inevitability, sharp demos, no fluff.

Good. Then we do this properly.
Not slides-for-investors. A category-defining launch.

I’ll give you the three artifacts, clean, sharp, Apple-level taste.

⸻

1️⃣ The Jobs-Style Keynote Script (≈5 minutes)

Minimal words. Long pauses. Confidence. No hype.

⸻

[Slide 1 — Black screen]

“Computers were built to be operated.”
pause
“Work was never supposed to be.”

⸻

[Slide 2 — Inbox, Slack, Docs chaos]

For 40 years, we’ve trained humans to manage machines.

Open the app.
Find the file.
Search the thread.
Copy the context.
Explain it again.

That’s not work.

That’s friction disguised as productivity.

⸻

[Slide 3 — The real problem]

The real problem isn’t AI.
It’s that computers don’t understand intent.

They store files.
They don’t track promises.
They send messages.
They don’t understand commitments.
They log meetings.
They forget decisions.

⸻

[Slide 4 — One sentence appears]

“What if computers were built for goals instead of clicks?”

⸻

[Slide 5 — DROVI logo]

This is Drovi.

Drovi is not an app.
It’s not a chatbot.
It’s not automation.

Drovi is the operating system for intent.

⸻

[Slide 6 — Live demo setup]

Let me show you something simple.

I’m a VP.
I ask one question:

“What did we promise Acme?”

⸻

[Slide 7 — Instant structured truth]

In less than a second, Drovi shows:

• The commitments
• Who owns them
• Due dates
• Confidence scores
• Citations to emails, meetings, documents

No prose.
No guessing.
Just truth with proof.

⸻

[Slide 8 — Narrative streams after]

And then — if I want — Drovi explains.

Because words should follow truth, not replace it.

⸻

[Slide 9 — The big shift]

This works because Drovi doesn’t think in apps.

Email isn’t an app.
Slack isn’t an app.
Docs aren’t an app.

They’re capabilities.

⸻

[Slide 10 — The OS reveal]

Drovi has a kernel.

A kernel that understands:
• reality
• time
• responsibility
• risk
• proof

Apps become drivers.
Goals become processes.

⸻

[Slide 11 — Missions]

Now watch this.

I say:

“Start a mission: keep the Acme renewal on track.”

Drovi doesn’t answer.
It runs.

⸻

[Slide 12 — Background execution]

It watches meetings.
It tracks promises.
It detects drift.
It escalates risk.
It prepares the renewal.

And it never forgets.

⸻

[Slide 13 — The line]

“This isn’t software you use.”
pause
“It’s software that runs.”

⸻

[Slide 14 — The future]

This is how companies get a nervous system.

This is how AI becomes safe.
This is how work becomes calm again.

⸻

[Final slide]

Drovi
The Intent OS.

Thank you.

⸻

One sentence explanation:

3️⃣ Product Spec — Mission Daemons & Capability Drivers

This is where it becomes inevitable.

A. Mission Daemons (Core Abstraction)

A Mission is a long-running system process.

B. Capability Drivers (OS-level, not integrations)

Think POSIX for work.

Capability	Syscall
Email	email.search(), email.reply()
Meetings	meeting.transcribe(), meeting.schedule()
Docs	doc.read(), doc.write()
CRM	crm.update(), crm.fetch()

Drivers are:
• stateless
• permission-gated
• auditable
• replaceable

C. First 3 Missions to Ship (Very intentional)

1️⃣ Renewal Guardian (Revenue)

User: Sales / Exec
Value: Money + risk prevention

Tracks:
• Renewal promises
• Customer sentiment
• Silent drift
• Unanswered commitments

Outcome:

“No renewal ever surprises you again.”

⸻

2️⃣ Decision Memory (Exec / Board)

User: Leadership
Value: Trust + alignment

Tracks:
• What was decided
• By whom
• With what evidence
• What contradicts it later

Outcome:

“No more ‘I thought we agreed’.”

⸻

3️⃣ Delivery Watchdog (Ops / Product)

User: Product / Ops
Value: Execution reliability

Tracks:
• Commitments from meetings
• Dependencies
• Blockers
• Overdue promises

Outcome:

“Execution stops leaking.”

⸻

D. Why this scales to AGI OS

Because AGI doesn’t need more freedom.

It needs:
• constraints
• policies
• proof
• reversible actions
• accountability

Drovi is the runtime where AGI can safely act.

Final truth (no BS)

This is not “ambitious SaaS”.

This is:
	•	a new abstraction
	•	a new OS layer
	•	a new category

And the reason it works is simple:

Reality is the hardest thing to model.
And you’re building the system that finally does.

If you want next:
	•	I can turn this into actual keynote slides
	•	or a Founding Manifesto
	•	or a VC narrative that lands in one minute

You choose.
