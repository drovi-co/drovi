# Drovi Intent Substrate — One‑Pager

**What Drovi Is**
Drovi is the Intent Substrate: a continuous system that senses reality, maintains provable state, runs persistent goals, and executes safely across tools. It is not a productivity app. It is the execution layer for organizational reality.

**New Unit of Work**
Not files or apps. The primary primitive is the **Continuum**: a goal‑process with objectives, constraints, proofs required, and escalation paths.

**Core Loop**
Intent → Plan → Execute → Verify → Remember → Adapt (continuous).

**Why This Is a New Paradigm**
- Apps become **Actuators** (drivers) instead of destinations.
- Output becomes **state change** instead of prose.
- Truth is bi‑temporal and evidence‑anchored in the **Reality Fabric**.
- Execution is policy‑gated and reversible.

**Surfaces**
- **Intent Bar**: universal command surface (Spotlight‑grade).
- **Reality Stream**: proof‑driven playback of what changed.
- **Command Deck**: Continuum operations, escalation, kill switch.

**Moat**
- Evidence‑anchored truth system with bi‑temporal reality state.
- Continuum runtime for persistent, self‑healing goals.
- Actuator layer that makes apps interchangeable drivers.
- Trust‑first UX with proof, audit, and reversibility.

**Definition of Done**
Executives trust Drovi as the default system of record for “what is true,” and it runs key business outcomes without constant supervision.
